      "The main objective of this Special Issue was to publish outstanding papers presenting\n",
      "cutting-edge research in the ﬁeld of surface treatment for metals. Nowadays, many surface treatment technologies are available in addition to advanced\n",
      "characterization techniques. The Special Issue gathers several outstanding articles on topics\n",
      "ranging from ferrous alloys (steel, cast iron) or magnetite nanoparticles/nanowires to\n",
      "non-ferrous alloys or amorphous materials. The focus of this Special Issue was on a newly developed system of alloys (Ti15MoSi)\n",
      "coated with ZrO2, which is a solution to improve the corrosion behaviour, biocompatibility,\n",
      "and the durability of human tissue [1]. It was revealed that zirconia is much more stable\n",
      "in simulated body ﬂuids (SBF) and has no side effects during the healing process of bone. The research highlighted the morphological aspects of zirconia coatings on the new alloy\n",
      "of titanium substrate, demonstrating better behaviour due to a more adherent coating. Additionally, it was observed that the Young modulus of metallic alloys is close to biological\n",
      "bone, which will avoid the stress shielding of the implant during the patient’s life. A different approach was discussed in order to evaluate the mechanical components\n",

      "(Mo–NiCrFeBSiC) coatings were applied with the atmospheric plasma spray (APS) method\n",
